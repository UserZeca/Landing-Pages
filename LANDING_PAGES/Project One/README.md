# Landing Page One 

Well, this is the first project to be placed in this repository, and it is a page developed for an internship selection process. However,
this project is intended to be just a source of learning and **all credits** for the **designer** and **page content** should be given to **[Agencia Fast 
Way](https://www.agenciafastway.com.br)**, the company responsible for the selection process.

## Development

The development was made with the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS 
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) (CDN)
* Javascript

The entire page was built responsively, using the **bootstrap** features, mainly the [grid system](https://getbootstrap.com.br/docs/4.1/layout/grid/).

* ### Phone Mask
    ![phonemask](https://github.com/UserZeca/Landing-Pages/blob/master/LANDING_PAGES/imgs-readme/project-one/phonemask.gif?classes=float-left)

    The phone's mask is designed not to accept letters and special characters. For this, it uses functions and events, which control the     text field, so that the field is in the format (99) 99999-9999.
